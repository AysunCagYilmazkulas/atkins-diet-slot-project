# Atkins Diet Slot - Slot Game Project

This project is a slot game themed around the Atkins Diet, designed to analyze and test slot machine mechanics. It includes paytable structures, symbol distributions, and simulation results.

## Contents

- **Parsheet Analysis:** Paytable and symbol distribution for the slot game.
- **Spin-Win Distribution:** Analysis of game outcomes and expected payouts.
- **Simulation:** Running slot game spins to evaluate the game's RTP (Return to Player).
- **Code Structure:** Jupyter Notebook implementation using Python.

## Files

- `atkins_diet.ipynb`: The main implementation of the Atkins Diet slot game.
- `atkins_diet_parsheet.ods`: The par sheet data defining symbol payouts and game rules.

## Usage

1. Open the `atkins_diet.ipynb` file in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
2. Analyze the paytable and spin-win distribution to understand game behavior.
3. Run the simulations to observe payout trends and performance.

## Requirements

To run this project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
